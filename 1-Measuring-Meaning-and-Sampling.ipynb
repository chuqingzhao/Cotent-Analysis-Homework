      "</p>, <p>Content analysis is best understood as a broad family of techniques. Effective researchers choose techniques that best help them answer their substantive questions. That said, according to <a href=\"/wiki/Klaus_Krippendorff\" title=\"Klaus Krippendorff\">Klaus Krippendorff</a>, six questions must be addressed in every content analysis:<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Krippendorff2004_5-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Krippendorff2004-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n",
      "</p>, <p>The simplest and most objective form of content analysis considers unambiguous characteristics of the text such as <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Word_frequencies\" title=\"Word frequencies\">word frequencies</a>, the page area taken by a newspaper column, or the duration of a <a href=\"/wiki/Radio\" title=\"Radio\">radio</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Television\" title=\"Television\">television</a> program. Analysis of simple word frequencies is limited because the meaning of a word depends on surrounding text.  <a href=\"/wiki/Key_Word_in_Context\" title=\"Key Word in Context\">Key Word In Context</a> (KWIC) routines address this by placing words in their textual context. This helps resolve ambiguities such as those introduced by <a href=\"/wiki/Synonym\" title=\"Synonym\">synonyms</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Homonym\" title=\"Homonym\">homonyms</a>.\n",
      "</p>, <p>A further step in analysis is the distinction between dictionary-based (quantitative) approaches and qualitative approaches. Dictionary-based approaches set up a list of categories derived from the frequency list of words and control the distribution of words and their respective categories over the texts. While methods in quantitative content analysis in this way transform observations of found categories into quantitative statistical data, the qualitative content analysis focuses more on the intentionality and its implications. There are strong parallels between qualitative content analysis and <a href=\"/wiki/Thematic_analysis\" title=\"Thematic analysis\">thematic analysis</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup>\n",

Quantitative analysis also takes a deductive approach.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-:12_8-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:12-8\">[8]</a></sup>\n",
      "</p>, <p><a href=\"/wiki/Siegfried_Kracauer\" title=\"Siegfried Kracauer\">Siegfried Kracauer</a> provides a critique of quantitative analysis, asserting that it oversimplifies complex communications in order to be more reliable. On the other hand, qualitative analysis deals with the intricacies of latent interpretations, whereas quantitative has a focus on manifest meanings. He also acknowledges an \"overlap\" of qualitative and quantitative content analysis.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-:03_7-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:03-7\">[7]</a></sup> Patterns are looked at more closely in qualitative analysis, and based on the latent meanings that the researcher may find, the course of the research could be changed.

    "In the context of rapid globalization, we are aware of the loss of local cultural diversity, leading to cultural hegemony and impoverishment of human society.With the wide accessibility of digital tools, an increasing number of ICH inheritors in China start documenting their craft and skill online. In particular, short videos are increasingly gaining popularity among internet users, which allows users to disseminate information in few-minute videos (Barta & Andalilbi, 2021 ; Zhang et al., 2014 ; Kleinrouweler, 2017 ). Different from the instant message and single-modality content, previous studies found that videos can more effectively convey information (Bakhshi, 2014 ) and attract attention (Bakhshi, 2016 ). Short video sharing could be in a less unpredictable manner than traditional video sharing because short videos create a more personalized viewing experience with great variability in users’ behavior and video creation (Cha et al., 2007 ). Short video sharing benefits ICH safeguarding, reaching broader and more global audiences and raising public awareness in ICH practices and past histories. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past decades, two challenges have occurred in intangible cultural heritages (ICH) safeguarding (Giglitto et al., 2021; Bronwyn & Mariat, 2008 ). Firstly, traditional museums’ expert-centric approach does not meet the expectation for heritage practitioners’ participation. Authoritative narrative of ICH excludes local communities’ understanding and their own stories in the context of diverse perspectives. The local communities’ views are valuable to preserve ICH-related information, benefit cultural heritage’s identification, collection and management (Afflexk & Kvan, 2008   ). It has been studied that the construction of different meanings of ICH leads to the protection of heritage (Afflexk & Kvan, 2008). Secondly, by presenting monotonous and authoritative voice of ICH preservation, audiences feel that cultural institutions are irrelevant to everyday life (Mancini, 2015 ; Nitzky, 2013 ; Simon, 2008 ). Presenting diverse stories and understanding of ICH from practitioners’ life experiences could help audiences personally understand the content and significance of ICH to our culture. Therefore, more active participations engaging local community and public is essential to ICH safeguarding efforts. "
