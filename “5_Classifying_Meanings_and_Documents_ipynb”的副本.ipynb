        "# Week 5 - Classifying Meanings & Documents\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall that Week 1 of this course focused on how to find and extract text data, while weeks 2 through 4 each covered a different type of content representations:\n",
        "\n",
        "2. computational linguistics (e.g., keyword count)\n",
        "3. clustering and topic modeling (e.g., LDA)\n",
        "4. embeddings (e.g., _word2vec_)\n",
        "\n",
        "Now we show how classification, arguably the most common social science task, can be done with different representations. Note that the second representation, *clustering*, allows us to stably partition text data (e.g., documents, turns of conversation) according to all patterns of covariation among available text features. Classification, by contrast, partitions text data according to only those features and their variation that enable us to mimic and extrapolate human annotations.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will show how to use a variety of classification methods, including Logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, decision trees and random forests, support vector machines and even a simple neural network, the perceptron. We will also demonstrate ensemble techniques that can link several such methods into a single, more accurate, classification pipeline. We will finally learn to use conventions and metrics to evaluate classifier performance on out-of-sample data. "

This data is the result of a content analytic / content extraction study in which Andrey Rzhetsky and colleagues from the National Library of Medicine, published [here](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000391) in [PLOS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/), gave eight annotators 10,000 sentence chunks from biomedical text in biomedical abstracts and articles, then asked them, in a loop design schematically illustrated below that provided 3 independent codings for each document. The sampling strategy pursued diversity by drawing from PubMed abstracts (1000) and full-text articles (9000: 20% from abstracts, 10% from introductions, 20% from methods, 25% from results, and 25% from discussions.) The dataset extract here involves respondents codes for sentences in terms of their *Evidence*: {0, 1, 2, 3, -1} where 0 is the complete lack of evidence, 3 is direct evidence present within the sentence, and -1 is didn't respond. (They also crowdsourced and analyzed *polarity*, *certainty*, and *number*). For example, consider the following two abutting sentence chunks: *\"Because null mutations in toxR and toxT abolish CT and TcpA expression in the El Tor biotype and also attenuate virulence...\"* [i.e., average certainty = 0], *\"...it is likely that the ToxR regulon has functional similarities between the two biotypes despite the clear differences in the inducing parameters observed in vitro\"* [i.e., average certainty = 1].\""

Given a set of features $X = {x_1, x_2, ..., x_m}$ and a target $y$, it can learn a non-linear function approximator for either classification or regression. It is different from logistic regression, in that between the input and the output layer, there can be one or more non-linear layers, called hidden layers. The following figure shows a one hidden layer MLP with scalar output. ![title](../data/multilayerperceptron_network.png) The leftmost layer, known as the input layer, consists of a set of \"neurons\" $\\{x_i | x_1, x_2, ..., x_m\\}$ representing the input features (e.g., weighted words). Each neuron in the hidden layer transforms the values from the previous layer with a weighted linear summation $w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_mx_m$, followed by a non-linear activation function $g(\\cdot):R \\rightarrow R$ - like the logistic or hyperbolic tan function. The output layer receives the values from the last hidden layer and transforms them into output values."
